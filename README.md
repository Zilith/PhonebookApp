# Phonebook Backend

## Description
This is the backend for a phonebook application. It provides a RESTful API for managing contacts, allowing users to list, add, delete, and search for people in the phonebook. The application is built with Node.js and Express, and it stores data in a MongoDB database.
## Features
1. **List Contacts**
	- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/persons`
	- Returns a list of contacts stored in the phonebook in JSON format
2. **Display General Information**
	- **Endpoint:** `GET /info`
	- Display the number of entries in the phonebook and the current server date/time
3. **Get a Contact by ID**
	- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/persons/:id`
	- Returns information about a specific contact. If the contact does not exist, it responds with an appropriate HTTP status code.
4. **Delete a Contact**
	- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/persons/:id`
	- Deletes a contact by its ID. Regardless of whether the ID exist or not, the response will be 204 No Content.
5. **Add a New Contact**
	- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/persons`
	- Adds a new contact to the phonebook. The ID is generated by MongoDB
	- If the name or number is missing, the request is rejected with an error message.
	- If the name already exist in the phonebook, the request is also rejected.
	- The backend enforces a validation rule where names stored in the database must be at least **three characters long**.
	- If the validation fails, the server responds with an appropriate error message.
	- A phone number must:
		- Have a length of **at least 8 characters**.
		- Be in the format **XX-XXXXXXXX** or **XXX-XXXXXXXX**, where:
			- The first part contains **2 or 3 digits**.
			- The second part contains **only numbers**.
	- A **custom validator** has been implemented in Mongoose to enforce this format.
	- If an invalid phone number is provided, the server responds with an **error message** and an appropriate HTTP status code
6. **Request Logging with Morgan**
	- The Morgan middleware has been integrated to log all HTTP request in the console. Additionally, it has been configured to display the data sent in POST and PUT requests.
7. **Frontend Integration**
	- The backend has been adapted to work with the previously developed frontend. Routes and configurations has been updated to ensure compatibility
8. **Deployment**
	- The backend has been deployed on a cloud service (Render). -> https://fullstackpart3-40i3.onrender.com
9. **MongoDB Database**
	- Data storage has been migrated to MongoDB, using Mongoose for database management.
	- A script (`mongo.js`) has been created to add and list contacts from the command line (`node mongo.js yourpassword Anna 040-1234556`).
	- Data persistence in the database has been implemented for the phonebook functionality.

# Phonebook Frontend
## Description
This is the frontend of the Phonebook application. It was initially developed with data stored in local state but was later integrated with a backend based on Node.js and Express, Whitch uses a MongoDB database.

## Features
1. **Add Names**
	- A simple application was created to add names to the phonebook.
	- Local state is used to store the entered names.
2. **Prevent Duplicate Names**
	- A validation was implement to prevent adding a name that already exists.
	- An alert is displayed to the user in case of duplicates.
3. **Add Phone Numbers**
	- The functionality was expanded to include phone numbers along with names.
	- A new field was added to the form for entering the number.
4. **Search and Filtering**
	- A search field was added to filter names in the phonebook
	- The search is case-insensitive
5. **Refactoring into Components**
	- The application was divided into reusable componentes:
		- **Filter:** Search field.
		- **PersonForm:** Form for adding new contacts.
		- **Persons:** List of contacts
6. **Integration with JSON Server**
	- A `json-server` was configured to handle persistent data in the local backend.
	- Initial data is now retrieved via an HTTP request using `axios` and `useEffect`.
7. **Data Persistence in Backend**
	- The functionality to save new contacts in the backend was implemented.
8. **Services Module**
	- The code was refactored to handle HTTP requests in a separete module (`services/persons.js`)
9. **Delete Contacts**
	- A button was added to delete contacts.
	- `window.confirm` is used to confirm the action before deletion.
10. **Edit Contacts**
	- Users can modify a phone number if the contact already exist.
	- Confirmation is requested before making changes.
11. **Status Notifications**
	- A notification message was added to indicate the success or failure of an operation.
	- The message automatically disappears after a few seconds.
	- Display an error message when a validation error occurs.
	- Errors returned by Mongoose are now shown in the UI
12. **Concurrency Error Handling**
	- Detects if a contact has already been deleted in another instance of the application.
	- Displays an error message if the operation fails due to outdated data.
## Installation and Usage
### Requirements
- Node.js installed
- A backend running on the same network or locally
### Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd phonebook-frontend
```
Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
### Configuration
Create a `.env` file and add the backend URL:
```sh
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```
### Execution
Start the application in development mode:
```sh
npm start
```
